 Ranames Paired Bluetooth Devices

 Very simple tool to rename paired devices on Windows platforms (useful for Windows 11). RUn the app, click "Enum paired", select your device, enter new name and click "Rename".
 
 The too uses our [Bluetooth Framework](https://www.btframework.com/bluetoothframework.htm) library.
